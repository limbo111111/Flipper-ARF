# Flipper-ARF: Automotive Research Firmware

## Overview

**Flipper-ARF** is an independently developed firmware fork for Flipper Zero, designed for **automotive research and experimentation**.

The goal of this firmware is to provide a **high-compatibility, protocol-focused build** for personal use, academic study, and responsible security research. It focuses on **automotive remote protocols, rolling code behavior, and keyfob ecosystem compatibility**.

This project may incorporate, adapt, or build upon **other open-source projects** in accordance with their licenses, with proper attribution.

### How to Build

Compact release build:

```
./fbt COMPACT=1 DEBUG=0 updater_package
```

---

## Project Scope

Flipper-ARF aims to achieve:

- Maximum compatibility with automotive Sub-GHz rolling and static protocols
- Accurate OEM-style remote emulation
- Stable encoder/decoder implementations
- Modular protocol expansion

**Primary focus:** VAG, PSA, Fiat, Ford, Asian platforms, and aftermarket alarm systems.

> ⚠ This is a protocol-focused research firmware, not a general-purpose firmware.

---

## Implemented Protocols

- [x] Mazda Siemens Protocol (5WK49365D) — ported from open-source references (testing required)
- [x] Full VAG, Fiat, Ford, Subaru, Kia, PSA support
- [x] D-Pad mapping (Lock / Unlock / Boot / Trunk) during emulation
- [x] VAG MFKey support and updated Keeloq codes
- [x] PSA XTEA brute force for saved → emulation workflow
- [x] Brute force of counter in saved → emulation scene for smoother keyfob emulation
- [x] RollJam app (Internal CC1101 for RX & TX captured signal; External CC1101 for jamming) — requires more real-world testing

---

## To Do / Planned Features

- [ ] Keeloq Key Manager inside firmware
- [ ] Add Scher Khan & Starline protocols
- [ ] Fix and reintegrate RollJam Pro app
- [ ] Expand and refine Subaru, Kia, PSA, and other manufacturer protocols
- [ ] Improve collaboration workflow to avoid overlapping work

---

## Design Philosophy

Flipper-ARF is built around:

- Clean and accurate protocol implementation
- Controlled rolling counter handling
- Automotive-specific encoder accuracy
- Minimal UI changes
- Stability over feature bloat

All modifications remain compatible with the **Flipper Zero open-source API structure** where possible.

---


## Research Direction

Future development focuses on:

- Rolling code synchronization behavior
- Manufacturer-specific signal modulation quirks
- Frame validation differences between OEM and aftermarket systems
- Encoder stability and replay consistency

---

## Contribution Policy

Contributions are welcome if they:

- Improve protocol stability
- Add automotive protocol support
- Improve parsing/encoding reliability
- Maintain structural and modular cleanliness

> Non-automotive features are considered out-of-scope for now.
